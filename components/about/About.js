                    Iâ€™m a frontend developer that finished my studies at Noroff
                    School of technology and digital media in Oslo, Norway in
                    2022. I have been working with frontend development for 2
                    years now and my interest in creative development comes from
                    my passion to beeing able to create something from idea to a
                    finished product. The opportunities and possibilities in web
                    development is what inspires me to do what I do.

                Through my studies at Noroff I have gathered most experience in
                HTML, CSS and Javascript. As well as creating responsive
                application through pure CSS, I also have worked with frameworks
                like Bootstrap and Tailwind. I do most of my designs in Figma,
                but I have also been working with Adobe XD.

                Some of the things I do want to learn more about is Javascript
                libraries such as React. I have worked with React and Next.js in
                my latest projects and want to emprove at this. I have also
                worked with Node.js, Tailwind, Wordpress, Strapi and Sanity.
